# Linux Programming - Code Examples

### Description

The code examples in this repository were taken and modified from the book Operativni Sistemi i Sistemski Softver II, Multiprocesni Operativni Sistemi 
(original title: Оперативни Системи и Системски Софтвер II, Мултипроцесни Оперативни Системи) Stevo Bozinovski. While testing the examples locally
the GCC compiler `v4.6.4` was used. Every example in this repository can be compiled with the following command:
```bash
gcc program.c -o program.out
```
As the examples are simple and every C file is a separate program CMake wasn't use as build system.
